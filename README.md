# Project--Diabetic-Retinopathy

Using Python and ML models to determine whether or not the patient has retinopathy. Diabetic Retinopathy is a primary cause of blindness in people with diabetes. An automated diabetic retinopathy screening system can be developed. On retina photographs of both damaged and healthy people, a neural network can be trained. This research will determine whether or not the patient has retinopathy.
